## It runs in 3 modes:
1. Caller (By pressing the left button)
2. Sender (By pressing the right button)
3. Listener (By pressing both buttons at the same time)

## It can:
- Make a call to a predefined number
- Send a predefined SMS message to a predefined number
- Receive calls and SMS messages from any number (Only visible with a computer)

## Setup
- Extract the following [library](https://github.com/MarcoMartines/GSM-GPRS-GPS-Shield "library") to your arduino/libraries folder.
- Unlock your SIM card's Pin number with a real phone by going to the phone's settings. That way the GSM shield can operate without issues. 
- Make sure that the SIM card is loaded and able to make and receive calls.
